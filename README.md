## Automated Elastic Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network shown below.

![ELK Stack Network](diagrams/ELK_Stack_Diagram.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the ELK Playbook file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._

### Description of the Topology

The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly available, in addition to restricting access to the network. The load balancer
implemented in this network ensures that none of the servers will be overwhelmed by the amount of traffic they receive, even in the event of a DDoS attack. The jump box provides tremendous value by creating as a single audit point that we can use to verify that all traffic reaching the virtual servers is from trusted sources preventing malicious software from infecting our system.  

Integrating the ELK server allows users on this netowrk to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the logs and system traffic. Filebeat
allows me to easily centralize log data from all the locations that I am interested in monitoring. It makes it simple to stay on top of any changes that might be problematic for my network.
- _TODO: What does Metricbeat record?_(Optional)

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.4   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Server   | 10.0.0.5   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Server   | 10.0.0.6   | Linux            |
| Web-3    | Server   | 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
| ELK-VM   | Analyzer | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies

The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the Jump Box machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
69.217.138.43

Machines within the network can only be accessed by the Jump Box Provisioner which uses IP 10.0.0.4.


A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | 69.217.138.43        |
| Web-1    | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-2    | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| Web-3    | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |
| ELK-VM   | No                  | 10.0.0.4             |

### Elk Configuration

Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- _TODO: What is the main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible?_

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- _TODO: In 3-5 bullets, explain the steps of the ELK installation play. E.g., install Docker; download image; etc._
- ...
- ...

The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- _TODO: List the IP addresses of the machines you are monitoring_

I have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- _TODO: Specify which Beats you successfully installed_

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- _TODO: In 1-2 sentences, explain what kind of data each beat collects, and provide 1 example of what you expect to see. E.g., `Winlogbeat` collects Windows logs, which we use to track user logon events, etc._

### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- _Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?_
- _Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?_
- _Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?

_As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc._
